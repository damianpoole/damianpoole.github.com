title: MacBook Air Review

### Bit of background

I have been wanting to get a new MacBook for a while, specifically a MacBook Air however
the fact that they are still do not have a retina screen has put me off. When I noticed that Apple
was about to release a [slightly improved version](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/29/updated-macbook-airs-faster-haswell/)
of the MacBook Air, I knew it was the right time to pick one up.

So, a new base 11" model was now £749. A pretty good price to be honest but it got even better.
They put up the remaining 2013 models for even cheaper. I managed to get a [base 11" mid 2013 Air
for £599](http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/macbook_air/11).
That a great bargain if I've ever seen one! If you're quick there might still be some left.

### On to the review

Lets first look at some facts about this piece of kit compared to the new mid 2014 model.

* [The processor is slightly slower](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/30/macbook-air-minor-speed-boosts/). Like you'll even notice that.
* [2014 model much slower SSD speeds](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/05/02/2014-macbook-airs-slow-storage/). This **will** be noticeable day to day.

So we've established it really is a great bargain, but what about using it day to day.

It's a joy. The 11" form factor is super portable, weighs next to nothing and the screen doesn't
feel like it's *too small* at any point due to OS X and the various features and multi-touch gestures.

For doing web development work there's more than enough power. I'm not sure if i'll regret only getting 4gb
of RAM later but right now it's plenty.

The battery life is seriously good. What is also great but not really a mentioned feature is the speed in which the battery
charges up.

Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone picking one up, especially at the £599 price point!
